;;; copilot-cli.el --- Launch Copilot CLI in an Eat terminal -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2026 Daniel Munoz

;; Author: Daniel Munoz
;; Version: 0.1.0
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "28.1") (eat "0.9"))
;; Keywords: tools, terminals
;; URL: https://github.com/danielmunoz/emacs-copilot-cli

;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a convenient way to launch GitHub Copilot CLI
;; inside an Eat terminal buffer.  Running `M-x copilot-cli' splits the
;; frame vertically (side by side) and opens an Eat terminal running
;; the `copilot-cli' command in the current project's root directory.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;;   M-x copilot-cli      Start or switch to the Copilot CLI session.
;;   M-x copilot-cli-stop Stop the running session and close its window.
;;
;; Customization:
;;
;;   `copilot-cli-program'     The executable to run (default: "copilot-cli").
;;   `copilot-cli-buffer-name' The buffer name (default: "*copilot-cli*").
